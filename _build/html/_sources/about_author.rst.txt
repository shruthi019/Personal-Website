About Me
========

Hello, dear reader!

I am Shruthi Rao, a freshman undergraduate at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women. I am pursuing 
B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering. I have a wide range of interests - from coding to playing the keyboard 
to learning foreign languages! In this website, I have described some projects I worked on as part of the 
TalentSprint WE program. I hope you find them interesting!

Feel free to drop in an email and let me know your thoughts on the website, or the projects, or to discuss some
French :P

Bisous,

Shruthi
